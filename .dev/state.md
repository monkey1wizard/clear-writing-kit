# GAL State

<!-- Per-task state (workflow step, deviations, test and review results) lives in the plan file's ## Status section, not here. This file tracks repo-level concerns only. -->

## Active Plans

| Plan | File | Plan Phase | Last Activity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feat-cross-agent-plugin-installer | `.dev/plans/feat-cross-agent-plugin-installer.prompt.md` | pipeline | 2026-10-02 |

<!-- When more than one plan is active, table order is priority order. `/gal whats-next` and `/gal wrap-up` use the first non-terminal row; if all rows are terminal, they fall back to the first row. -->

## Recent Close-outs

<!-- Bounded to at most 2 rows, newest first. Authority + Landing-column semantic: conventions/token-budget.md § Bounded Session State (.dev/state.md). Do not restate that policy here. -->

| Date | Plan | Landing | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Follow-ups

<!-- Bounded to at most 5 rows. A row only leaves this table by promotion into a plan's own task list, never by deletion or expiry. Authority + Route-column semantic: conventions/token-budget.md § Bounded Session State (.dev/state.md). Do not restate that policy here. -->

| Date | Origin | Finding | Route |

## Session Continuity

<!-- Keep one row per active plan. Match rows by the paired source plan path. -->

| Plan | Source Plan | Last Session | Stopped At | Next Step | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| feat-cross-agent-plugin-installer | `.dev/plans/feat-cross-agent-plugin-installer.md` | 2026-10-02 | T-11 independent tests PASS and audit CLEAR at b0f2d66 | Run T-12 documentation after convergence | T-01 through T-11 complete. Temporary agy CODER route active. Restore codex on terminal handback. Native Claude/Codex fixture cycles pass. Marketplace retention and backup-based exact restoration limits must be documented. New-session human acceptance is not established. Two existing full npm test failures remain unresolved. |
